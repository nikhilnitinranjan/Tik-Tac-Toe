# Tik-Tac-Toe
Hey friends, today in this Project We See how to create a Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML CSS & JavaScript.

Tic tac toe is a multiplayer game and the players of this game have to position their marks(sign) 
so that they can construct a continuous line of three cells or boxes vertically, 
horizontally, or diagonally. An opponent can stop a win by blocking the end of the opponent’s line.

In our program [Tic Tac Toe Game], at first, on the webpage, 
there is a selection box with the game title and two buttons which are labeled as
 “Player(X)” and “Player(O)”. Users must select one option or button to continue the game.
 If the user selects the X then the bot will be O and if the user selects the O then the bot will be X.

Once the user selects one of them, the selection box will disappear and the playboard is visible.
There are the player names at the top in the playboard section and it indicates or shows whose turn is now.
At the center of the webpage, there is a tic tac toe play area with nine square boxes.
Once you click on the particular box then there is visible a sign or icon which you have chosen on the selection box.

Once you click on any box then after a couple of seconds the bot will automatically select the box which is not selected by you or the bot before, and the opposite icon is visible there means if your icon is X then the bot will have O. 
Once a match is won by someone, 
the playboard section will be hidden and the result box appears with the winner sign or icon and a replay button.

If no one wins the match and all nine-box selected then again the playboard section is hidden and the result box appears with 
“Match has been drawn text” and a replay button. Once you click on the replay button, 
the current page reloads and you can play again.
